# GameBasedLearning
This project is concerned with creating a game to help first year students who are taking a theory-heavy course. The game will apply a work-based learning approach.


## Running the Game
1. An installer in the form of a .exe can be double clicked and run on windows machines.
2. Run through steps explained by installer to install the game, if your system does not trust the machine, click 'more information' and you will be able to continue with the installation.
3. Launch the installed game, 'BigOAdventure'.
4. Once you have started the game, the controls and guidance are in the 'Guide' section of the main menu.
